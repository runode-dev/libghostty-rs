/// [Overscan](RenderState#overscan) for how the extra rows are used.
pub use ffi::RenderStateOverscan as Overscan;

/// Represents the state required to render a visible screen (a viewport) of
/// a terminal instance.
///
/// This is stateful and optimized for repeated updates from a single terminal
/// instance and only updating dirty regions of the screen.
///
/// The key design principle of this API is that it only needs read/write
/// access to the terminal instance during the update call. This allows the
/// render state to minimally impact terminal IO performance and also allows
/// the renderer to be safely multi-threaded (as long as a lock is held
/// during the update call to ensure exclusive access to the terminal instance).
///
/// The basic usage of this API is:
///
///  1. Create an empty render state
///  2. Update it from a terminal instance whenever you need.
///  3. Read from the render state to get the data needed to draw your frame.
///
/// # Dirty Tracking
///
/// Dirty tracking is a key feature of the render state that allows renderers
/// to efficiently determine what parts of the screen have changed and only
/// redraw changed regions.
///
/// The render state API keeps track of dirty state at two independent layers:
/// a global dirty state that indicates whether the entire frame is clean,
/// partially dirty, or fully dirty, and a per-row dirty state that allows
/// tracking which rows in a partially dirty frame have changed.
///
/// The user of the render state API is expected to unset both of these.
/// The update call does not unset dirty state, it only updates it. After
/// successfully rendering a complete frame, use [`Snapshot::clean`] to unset
/// both layers in one call. The granular setters remain available for
/// callers that only consume part of a frame.
///
/// An extremely important detail: **setting one dirty state doesn't unset
/// the other.** For example, setting the global dirty state to false does
/// not reset the row-level dirty flags. So, the caller of the render state
/// API must be careful to manage both layers of dirty state correctly.
///
/// # Overscan
///
/// By default, the render state captures exactly the rows visible in the
/// viewport. That is all a renderer needs when it draws whole rows.
///
/// Some renderers draw the grid shifted by a fraction of a row, most commonly
/// to scroll smoothly. While the grid is shifted, part of a row just outside
/// the viewport becomes visible at one edge, and the renderer needs that
/// row's content to draw it. Overscan asks the render state to capture extra
/// rows above and below the viewport for this purpose.
///
/// Request overscan with [`RenderState::set_overscan`]. The request applies to
/// every update after it is set. [Row iterations](RowIteration) then visit
/// the extra rows along with the viewport, from top to bottom: the rows above
/// the viewport, the viewport rows, and then the rows below it.
/// [`RowIteration::viewport_y`] tells you where each row belongs. Rows above
/// the viewport have negative values, viewport rows are 0 through
/// [`rows`](Snapshot::rows) - 1, and rows below the viewport start at
/// [`rows`](Snapshot::rows).
///
/// Extra rows are only captured when they exist. There is nothing above the
/// first line of scrollback, and there is nothing below the viewport while it
/// is scrolled to the bottom, which is the usual case. After an update,
/// [`Snapshot::overscan`] reports how many rows were actually captured on
/// each side. Don't shift the grid toward a side where nothing was captured.
///
/// Extra rows carry the same data as viewport rows, including cells, styles,
/// dirty flags, and selection. The cursor is only reported when it is inside
/// the viewport.
///
/// The render state doesn't store the scroll position. If you need it, read
/// [`Terminal::scrollbar`](crate::Terminal::scrollbar) or
/// [`Terminal::viewport_active`](crate::Terminal::viewport_active) at the same
/// time as you call [`RenderState::begin_update`], while you have exclusive
/// access to the terminal. The values then describe the same moment as the
/// render state.
///
/// # Row identity
///
/// Every row has an [id](RowIteration::id) that stays with the row as it
/// moves. When the viewport scrolls by one row, each row shows up one
/// position higher or lower in the next update but keeps its id. Ids work
/// with or without overscan.
///
/// Ids let a renderer keep expensive per-row work, such as shaped text or a
/// prepared texture, in its own cache keyed by id. A cached entry can be
/// reused when both of these are true:
///
///  1. A row with the same id is present in the new update.
///  2. That row's [dirty flag](RowIteration::dirty) is not set.
///
/// The dirty flag is conservative. A row may be marked dirty even though its
/// content didn't change. For example, every row is currently marked dirty
/// after the viewport scrolls. Rebuilding a dirty row is always correct.
///
/// An id disappears when its row is no longer captured, is removed from
/// scrollback, or is changed in place by the terminal (for example, when a
/// program scrolls only part of the screen). Ids are never reused, so an old
/// id can never match a different row. Cache entries for ids that no longer
/// appear can be discarded.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Creating and updating render state
///
/// ```rust
/// // Create a terminal and render state, then update the render state
/// // from the terminal. The render state captures a snapshot of everything
/// // needed to draw a frame.
/// use libghostty_vt::{Terminal, RenderState};
///
/// let mut terminal = Terminal::new(40, 5).unwrap();
/// let mut render_state = RenderState::new().unwrap();
///
/// // Feed some styled content into the terminal.
/// terminal.vt_write(b"Hello, \x1b[1;32mworld\x1b[0m!\r\n");
/// terminal.vt_write(b"\x1b[4munderlined\x1b[0m text\r\n");
/// terminal.vt_write(b"\x1b[38;2;255;128;0morange\x1b[0m\r\n");
///
/// assert!(render_state.update(&terminal).is_ok());
/// ```
///
/// ## Splitting an update
///
/// ```rust
/// use libghostty_vt::{RenderState, Terminal};
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25)?;
/// let mut render_state = RenderState::new()?;
///
/// // Use `update` unless you need to minimize how long terminal access is
/// // held. `begin_update` copies the terminal-dependent state into an update
/// // token, then `end` finishes the deferred render-state work.
/// let update = render_state.begin_update(&terminal)?;
///
/// // Terminal access is no longer needed here.
/// let snapshot = update.end()?;
///
/// // Read from the snapshot to draw the frame.
/// let _dirty = snapshot.dirty()?;
/// # Ok(())}
/// ```
///
/// ## Checking dirty state
///
/// ```rust
/// // Check the global dirty state to decide how much work the renderer
/// // needs to do. After rendering, reset it to false.
/// # use libghostty_vt::{Terminal, RenderState, render::Dirty};
/// # let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25).unwrap();
/// # let mut render_state = RenderState::new().unwrap();
/// let snapshot = render_state.update(&terminal).unwrap();
///
/// match snapshot.dirty().unwrap() {
///     Dirty::Clean => println!("Frame is clean, nothing to draw."),
///     Dirty::Partial => println!("Partial redraw needed."),
///     Dirty::Full => println!("Full redraw needed."),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Reading colors
///
/// ```rust
/// // Retrieve colors (background, foreground, palette) from the render
/// // state. These are needed to resolve palette-indexed cell colors.
/// # use libghostty_vt::{Terminal, RenderState};
/// # let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25).unwrap();
/// # let mut render_state = RenderState::new().unwrap();
/// let snapshot = render_state.update(&terminal).unwrap();
/// let colors = snapshot.colors().unwrap();
///
/// println!(
///     "Background: {:02x}{:02x}{:02x}",
///     colors.background.r, colors.background.g, colors.background.b
/// );
/// println!(
///     "Foreground: {:02x}{:02x}{:02x}",
///     colors.background.r, colors.background.g, colors.background.b
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## Reading cursor state
///
/// ```rust
/// // Read cursor position and visual style from the render state.
/// use libghostty_vt::render::CursorViewport;
/// # use libghostty_vt::{Terminal, RenderState};
/// # let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25).unwrap();
/// # let mut render_state = RenderState::new().unwrap();
/// let snapshot = render_state.update(&terminal).unwrap();
///
/// if snapshot.cursor_visible().unwrap() {
///     if let Some(CursorViewport { x, y, .. }) = snapshot.cursor_viewport().unwrap() {
///         let style = snapshot.cursor_visual_style().unwrap();
///         println!("Cursor at ({x}, {y}), style {style:?}");
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Scrolling smoothly with overscan
///
/// ```rust
/// // Draw one frame of a smooth scroll. `offset_px` comes from the renderer's
/// // own scroll animation: how far the grid is shifted up, from zero up to
/// // but not including one row height.
/// use libghostty_vt::{RenderState, Terminal, render::{Overscan, RowIterator}};
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// # let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25)?;
/// # let cell_height = 16;
/// # let mut offset_px = 4;
/// # let mut draw_row = |_: &_, _: i32| {};
/// let mut render_state = RenderState::new()?;
/// let mut rows = RowIterator::new()?;
///
/// // Once, when setting up the render state. One row below the viewport is
/// // enough to draw the partially visible row at the bottom edge.
/// render_state.set_overscan(Overscan { above: 0, below: 1 })?;
///
/// // Each frame.
/// let snapshot = render_state.update(&terminal)?;
///
/// // With no row below the viewport, there is nothing to scroll into.
/// if snapshot.overscan()?.below == 0 {
///     offset_px = 0;
/// }
///
/// let mut row_iter = rows.update(&snapshot)?;
/// while let Some(row) = row_iter.next() {
///     draw_row(row, row.viewport_y()? * cell_height - offset_px);
/// }
/// # Ok(())}
/// ```
///
/// ## Caching per-row work by id
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::collections::HashMap;
/// use libghostty_vt::{RenderState, Terminal, render::{RowId, RowIterator}};
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// # let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25)?;
/// # let mut render_state = RenderState::new()?;
/// # let mut rows = RowIterator::new()?;
/// # let prepare = |_: &_| ();
/// // The renderer's own map from row id to prepared row.
/// let mut cache: HashMap<RowId, ()> = HashMap::new();
///
/// let snapshot = render_state.update(&terminal)?;
/// let mut row_iter = rows.update(&snapshot)?;
/// while let Some(row) = row_iter.next() {
///     let id = row.id()?;
///     if row.dirty()? || !cache.contains_key(&id) {
///         cache.insert(id, prepare(row));
///     }
/// }
/// # Ok(())}
/// ```
///
/// ## Iterating rows and cells
///
/// ```rust
/// // Iterate rows via the row iterator. For each dirty row, iterate its
/// // cells, read codepoints/graphemes and styles, and emit ANSI-colored
/// // output as a simple "renderer".
/// use libghostty_vt::{Terminal, RenderState};
/// use libghostty_vt::style::Underline;
///
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// # let terminal = Terminal::new(80, 25).unwrap();
/// # let mut render_state = RenderState::new()?;
/// use libghostty_vt::render::{RowIterator, CellIterator};
///
/// // During setup:
/// let mut rows = RowIterator::new()?;
/// let mut cells = CellIterator::new()?;
///
/// // On each frame:
/// let snapshot = render_state.update(&terminal)?;
/// let colors = snapshot.colors()?;
///
/// let mut row_iter = rows.update(&snapshot)?;
/// let mut row_index = 0;
///
/// while let Some(row) = row_iter.next() {

///     print!(
